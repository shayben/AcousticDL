# AcousticDL
For the acoustic modeling workshop @ microsoft

Please make sure you have the following installed on your machine (preferably a CUDA enabled device):

*	Python 3.7. Ideally, under the latest Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/

*	A working installation of the latest Pytorch from https://pytorch.org/

*	Git from https://gitforwindows.org/

*	a clone of the following workshop repository: https://github.com/shayben/AcousticDL.git

**	After cloning the repo and setting up the above prerequisites, execute the install.bat script.
This should install some python packages and download ~30GB of audio so make sure you have the space.

Following this guide should help minimize the set-up time so we can be productive and focused.
Looking forward to seeing you next week!
